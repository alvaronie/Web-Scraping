# Web-Scraping
In this repository there is a function defined in python that will be useful to provide solutions to correct errors when executing a command, taking information from the Stack Overflow website.
The get_SOS_help function defined in this repository is intended to provide solutions to errors that occur while programming. Our goal is to be able to automatically enter the error message in the Stack Overflow search engine, filter by the most voted answers, select the most voted one and, finally, print this answer. In this process we will have to take into account the appearance of the coockies window and the possible appearance of a captcha.
